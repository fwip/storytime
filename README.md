Intro
=====

StoryTime is a javascript web application designed to let users create, share,
and play interactive games. It is currently under heavy development.

A live version of the app can be demo'ed at http://fwip.github.io/storytime.


Getting Started (Development)
=============================

If you'd like to hack on the code, install [git](git-scm.com) and [Bower](bower.io), then run:

    git clone https://github.com/Fwip/storytime.git
    bower install

Found a Bug? Got an Idea?
=========================

If you've got comments, questions, bug reports or feature requests, please file
a new issue at https://github.com/fwip/storytime/issues. Remember that, so far,
this is a one-woman side project, and it may take me a bit of time to get
around to addressing your report.
